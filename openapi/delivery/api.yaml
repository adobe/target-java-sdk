          description: This is the `sessionId` that should be generated and maintained by the API user for the current session the user is a part of. The `sessionId` can be any printable string except a space, ?, or /. It should be between 1 and 128 characters in length. <br><br> For a particular session, its value must stay the same across multiple requests for the same user since routing to a particular node in the edge cluster, which contains the user profile, is done using the `sessionId`. The session is active for 30 minutes on the server side. Therefore, you shouldnâ€™t use a different `sessionId` for a particular `tntId` or `thirdPartyId` within 30 minutes of the last request made with the same `tntId` or `thirdPartyId`. Otherwise, changes to the profile could be inconsistent and unpredictable. <br><br>Furthermore, using the same `sessionId` with different `tntId` or `thirdPartyId` may cause unpredictable changes to the profiles.
