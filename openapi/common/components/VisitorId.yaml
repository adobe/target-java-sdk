VisitorId:
  type: object
  description: |
    Object that contains the identifiers for the visitor.
    If no id is provided in the first request, Target will generate a VisitorId with a tntId. The code that runs on the
    client side is then responsible for passing this tntId value on all subsequent calls.
    
    Validation
      * Either tntId, thirdPartyId or maketingCloudVisistorId required.
  properties:
    tntId:
      type: string
      maxLength: 128
      description: |
        Tnt id - an unique identifier (UUID).
        If no visitor id is provided the TNT id will be generated by the TNT server.
        The TNT id retunred by the server may also contain the profile location hint,
        with the same format as for other endpoints (standard/ajax/json/..).
        Example 32440324234-2343423.23_41, in this example the 23_41 is the profile location hint.
        Tnt id retuned in the response (containting the profile location hint) should be used in the subsequent requests

        Validation
          * Should not contain a '.' (dot) unless the dot delimits the location hint.
